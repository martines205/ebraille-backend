,ALICE WAS BEGINNING TO GET VERY
TIRED OF SITTING BY HER SISTER ON
THE BANK1 AND OF HAVING NOTHING
TO DO3 ONCE OR TWICE SHE HAD
PEEPED INTO THE BOOK HER SISTER
WAS READING1 BUT IT HAD NO

OR CONVERSATIONS8

VERY SLEEPY AND STUPID71 WHETHER
THE PLEASURE OF MAKING A
DAISY-CHAIN WOULD BE WORTH THE
TROUBLE OF GETTING UP AND PICKING
THE DAISIES1 WHEN SUDDENLY A
,WHITE ,RABBIT WITH PINK EYES RAN
CLOSE BY HER4
